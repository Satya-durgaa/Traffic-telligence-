# 🚦 TrafficTelligence – Traffic Volume Prediction System

TrafficTelligence is a **Flask-based web application** that predicts **traffic volume** using **Machine Learning**.  
It takes user inputs such as time, weather, and location, and returns a prediction of expected traffic, helping with **better planning and reducing delays**.  

---

## 🌟 Features
- Predicts **traffic volume** using a trained ML model (Random Forest Regressor).  
- **Flask backend** for seamless integration between frontend and model.  
- **User-friendly interface** built with HTML & CSS.  
- Handles **data preprocessing**: missing values, scaling, and encoding.  
- Real-time prediction output.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Traffic congestion is a major challenge in cities.  
The goal of this project is to create a **prediction system** that can forecast traffic volume in advance and help city planners, commuters, and businesses **manage traffic effectively**.  

---

## 💡 Solution
- Built a **Flask web app** that accepts input values like time, weather, and location.  
- Integrated a **Random Forest ML model** to predict traffic volume.  
- Displayed results in a **simple, easy-to-use web interface**.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned dataset, handled missing values, performed scaling & encoding.  
2. **Model Training:** Trained a **Random Forest Regressor** on traffic dataset.  
3. **Integration:** Connected the trained model with Flask backend.  
4. **Prediction:** User enters inputs → Model predicts traffic → Output displayed on web page.  

---

## 🚀 Outcome & Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience in **backend + ML integration**.  
- Built a **real-time prediction system** with Flask.  
- Understood how to make an **end-to-end web application** from dataset to deployment.
